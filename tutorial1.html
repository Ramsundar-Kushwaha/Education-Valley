            <h3>Difference between Structured Oriented and Object Oriented Programming.</h3>
            <p><b>Procedure-Oriented / Structured Programming:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Structure Oriented Programming is also known as Procedure Oriented Programming.</li>
                <li>It is basically a sequence of instructions that need to be done for solving a problem.</li>
                <li>For doing so, number of function need to be written for completing the task.</li>
                <li>Function have their sequence and sequence of callings.</li>
                <li>Each function contains list of instructions inorder to excuting them in proper sequence.</li>
                <li>Each function had it data and local variables.many important data items are placed as global. so, that they may accessed by all the functions.</li>
                <li>Global data are more reluctant to change by a function.</li>
                <li>In large program it is quite difficult to identify global variables. This urgently needs a revision in external data structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="drowBack">
                <h3>Drawbacks of Structured Programming:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emphasis on developing Algorithm.</li>
                    <li>Large program divided into smaller parts known as <u>Function.</u></li>
                    <li>Function use to share global data.</li>
                    <li>Data moves openly from one function to another.</li>
                    <li>It employs top down approach in program design.</li>
                    <li>Function transform data into different form.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <hr>

            <b><p>Object Oriented Programming</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Object Oriented Programming treat data as critical element in the program development and donot allow it's free flow.</li>
                <li>It used to tie data and function together and prevent data from accidental modification from outside function.</li>
                <li>It allow decomposintion of problem into a entity called an <u>Object.</u></li>
                <li>Once these entities are defined then data member and member function are difined to work upon.</li>
                <li>This is  an approach that's provide a way of modularizing by creating memory area for both data menber and member function in the form of template. so as to provide copy of such modules on demand.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Basic concept of Object Oriented Programming:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Class:</b></li>
                <li>Class contains data and member function to work on that data.</li>
                <li>It is a user defined type.</li>
                <li>Class is a collection of object of similar type.</li>
                <div class="example">
                    <pre>
                        /*for example:*/

                        class human{  /*here, human is the class...*/
                            private:
                                char physicalAppereance;
                                char color;
                                char behaviour;
                                int height;
                                float weight;
                        };
                    </pre>
                </div>                  
                <br>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Object:</b></li>
                <li>Person, Place, Things are entities and these entities has features and characterstics, these entites are called an <u>Object.</u></li>
                <div class="example">
                    <pre>
in the above example, if human is a class then object can be male and female...
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <br>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Abstraction:</b></li>
                <li>Abstraction refers to representing essential details or features without including background details or functionality.</li>
                <div class="example">
                    <pre>
may be everybody drives a car or bike or any vehicle.
have you ever notice, what happens internally when you put 
the key and turns on the bike? behind turning on, there are several
mechanism working inside the bike internally which we don't know exactly.
this doesn't need to  be known. from this example we can relate to Abstraction
in OOP and we can say that "hiding of data which we really don't need to know and representing
only essential features which we need is known as <u>Abstraction</u>".
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <br>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Encaptulation:</b></li>
                <li>Wrapping up of data and member function into a single unit is known as <u>Encaptulation.</u></li>
                <br>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Inheritance:</b></li>
                <li>Inheritance is the feature where property of one class is acquired by another class.</li>
                <li>Inheritance helps in implementing the concept of code reusability.</li>
                <br>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Polymorphism:</b></li>
                <li>Polymorphism is a concept where a function response differently on the basis of input.</li>
                <li>Here input is the parameter, that is used to pass.</li>
                <li>Polymorphism cames from Greek where "Poly" means "many" and "Morphism" means "shape".</li>
                <li>Polymorphism helps in performing different task or operation by overloading a function and that function will be called with same name but with different parameters and operations.</li>
